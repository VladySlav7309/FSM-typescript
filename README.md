# FSM-typescript

A simple typescript library for creating finite state machines.

## Setup
- Clone the repo
- run 'npm install' with node 16.14.0+
- run 'npm run dev' to see a dummy html page with a Module-Three example of the library usage

## Testing
Make sure to check both 'npm run test' and 'npm run test:coverage" to see extensive information and coverage of the repo code.

## Contribution Guidelines
There are husky pre-commit and pre-push hooks. They will prevent entry of code that was not properly linted, formatted and tested.
Besides, the main branch is protected from direct pushes so in order to contribute you should open a PR.
